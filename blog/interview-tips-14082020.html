During a Campus Placement Interview:

Me: Given an array of non-negative integers, 
you have to find . . . <explained the problem statement>
Simran: Gotcha, it's easy. 😎 Just give me two minutes.

<after 5 minutes of complete silence>
Me: Are you stuck somewhere?
Simran: No no, I'm solving on paper. 😎 Just give me two minutes.

<after another 5 minutes of complete silence>
Me: Are you stuck somewhere? Would be great if we can discuss your approach?
Simran: No no. 😎 Just give me two minutes. I'm just done with the logic.

<after another 5 minutes of complete silence>
Me: I think we should discuss your approach now, Simran. Just let me know what's going on in your head, how are you approaching the problem?
Simran: I'm almost there. Actually, I'm planning to use `Binary Search` to reach that element.

Me: Ok, so are you planning to sort the list before doing that?
Simran: 😧 🥴 🤯 List to already sorted hai na?

Me: No Simran, please read the question carefully once again.
Simran: 😰 😢 
Simran: I thought the list is sorted, I wasted a lot of time. 🥺

Me: Oho, don't worry. Don't panic, we still have a lot of time.
Let's do it. Let me know if you need more example test cases.
I'm here to help you! 😇

Simran: No no, I don't need your help. Just give me 2 minutes.
Me: Simran, but this time I request you to please keep explaining to me your approach, that would be great. 

<Simran started `thinking out loud now`>

<after a successful dry-run with a sample test case>

Simran: Yay, it works. This is how we'll reach the solution. 😎
Me: Ok. But what if the input array is : [0]

Simran: 😧 🥴 🤯 List me `0` bhi ho sakta hai kya?
Me: Yes Simran, please read the question carefully once again.
Simran: 😰 😢 Oh, ok. Just give me two minutes.

<after 2 minutes>
Simran: Now this Looks perfect! 😎

Me: Ok, let me check. But what if the input array is : []

Simran: 😧 🥴 🤯 List `empty` bhi ho sakti hai kya?

Lessons:

0. Pay 100% attention when the interviewer is explaining the problem statement. 🙇🏻‍
1. `Don't assume` anything, NEVER ❌
2. Before starting to solve the problem, discuss few more test cases with the interviewer. ✅
3. Ask clarifying questions <think of corner cases> 
4. Only move on to coding, once you're done discussing your approach.
5. `Think out Loud` while you approach the problem

And remember, 
"Interviewers are your friends, not bosses!" 😉
